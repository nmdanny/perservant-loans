# perservant-loans

This is a basic CRUD REST service for handling loans(borrowing or lending money), using persistent-postgresql for the database backend, and also esqueleto for complex queries if needed, and servant for defining and serving the RESTful API.

Project is based on https://github.com/parsonsmatt/servant-persistent , but with different models. I intend to add more features(once/if I figure how to do them), such as authentication, authorization, and try removing boilerplate and make the code more generic.
